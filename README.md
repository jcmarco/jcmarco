<h1> Hi World 🪐 </h1>

In 1996, I started professionally with "The Internet."
<hr/>

It was when I created one of the first Internet Providers in Spain, and suddenly, we started offering a new technology called the World Wide Web (WWWW) done with HTML.
<br/>
Here is my first web page (and some of the earliest web pages done for a company); at this time, Perl was almost the only option available.

<h3>A long road to reach it: </h3>
<div align="left"> 
<ol>
  <li>I had to buy CDs with the Slackware Linux Distribution and its source code</li>
  <li>Compile a Linux server when it was only kernel 0.96</li>
  <li>Fight with kernel drivers in C to run serial multi-port cards for attaching our modems with the amazing speed of 28800 bauds (we were the fastest in the market!)</li>
  <li> Run all SMTP, NTP, DNS, and HTTP servers in local Linux servers and some Windows NT Server...</li>
  <li>a Cisco router with our dedicated X.25 direct line from Madrid to Paris to connect to "the Internet" (Hi RIPE!)</li>
</ol>

Later, a lot of stuff evolved at light and warp speeds 🚀
<hr/>
Lots of new programming languages, data centers, Linux servers, Windows servers, NAS, SAN, Firewalls, Databases, web servers, application servers, and routers.
<br/>
Virtualization, CLOUD architectures (started cloud with AWS in 1996), more development methodologies, more microservices, dockers, Kubernetes, agile methodology, and new open source projects with more amazing tools every time.
<hr/>
I am always enjoying it as my first time when I started programming Basic in a glorious Sinclair ZX81;
<hr/>
<h3> Now... </h3> 
🛠 I keep learning and being amazed by all new market trends, products, and solutions.
